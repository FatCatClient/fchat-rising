# F-Chat Rising
This repository contains a heavily customized version of the mainline F-Chat 3.0 client.

## TL;DR

### Setting Up
FChat-Rising uses NodeJS `16.x` and may not work on newer versions. Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to simplify your life.

```bash
# Windows only:
npm install --global --production --vs2015 --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools node-gyp

# Ubuntu only:
sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev

# MacOS only:
brew install python-setuptools

# All operating systems:
git clone https://github.com/hearmeneigh/fchat-rising.git
cd fchat-rising
yarn

# Optional; make sure your commits are anonymous
git config --local user.name "SOME NAME"
git config --local user.email "some@email.com"
```

### Dev Mode
Run two processes simultaneously:

```bash
# Process 1 -- watch
cd electron
yarn watch
```

```bash
# Process 2 -- app
cd electron
yarn start
# Use `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the Chromium debugger.
```

### Build
```bash
cd electron
yarn build:dist
node pack.js
```


## Key Differences

1. **Profile matching** automatically compares your profile with others to determine with whom you are compatible.
1. **Automatic ad posting** repeatedly posts and rotates ads on selected channels.
1. **Link previews** popup shows a preview of an image / video when you hover your mouse over a link.
1. **Caching** speeds up profile loads and other actions.
1. **Smart filters** let you choose what kind of ads and posts you see in the chat.

## How to Set Up Ads

1. Open a conversation channel of your preference, such as `#Sex Driven LFRP`
1. Locate the `Ad Editor` button underneath your character overview on the left.
1. Enter one or more ads and tag them appropriately
1. Click `Save`
1. Click the `Post Ads` underneath the `Ad Editor` option.
1. Select the tags you wish to use and which channel to post them in and then click `Start Posting Ads` on the bottom.
1. To stop, click the red stop button next to the `Post Ads` button.


## FAQ

1. The more information you have in your profile (**non-custom** kinks in particular), the better the matching quality will be. The algorithm considers the following data points:
   *   Age
   *   Gender
   *   Sexual preference
   *   Dominance preference
   *   Human/anthro preference
   *   Post length preference
   *   Position preference
   *   Non-custom kinks
   *   Species
1. Matching for non-binary genders relies on kinks. For example, if your non-binary character has a preference for females, make sure 'females' are listed as a favorite kink.
   *    Similarly if you want to match with non-binary genders -- independent of your characters' gender -- add your preferred non-binary types into your kink list.
3. 'Underage' kink is considered to apply to characters aged 16 or above; 'ageplay' kink is considered to apply to characters aged 16 or below.
4. 'Older characters' and 'younger characters' kink preferences are interpreted as age difference of 8+ years.
5. Comparison results will get faster over time, as more and more character data is cached.
6. If you have a species-fluid character (e.g. you play both your character as both a human and an anthro), you can indicate this by setting your **species** in your character profile in the following ways. F-List Rising will then score you against the best fitting type. 
    * Human or tiger
    * Human, tiger, or dragon 
    * Anthro (Horse or Tiger)
    * Dragon (Dwarf, Elf, or Human)
    * Elf (optionally vampire or dwarf)
    * Feline (optionally horse, tiger, or elf)


## Todo / Ideas
*   Collect data on ads / responses to determine which ads work best
*   Preview mode should allow detaching from the main window
*   Improve log browsing
*   Conversation bot API
*   'Filter unmatching ads' is not channel specific -- it's either on everywhere or nowhere
*   What are the things that would make your profile more compatible with others?


# F-List Exported
This repository contains the open source parts of F-list and F-Chat 3.0.
All necessary files to build F-Chat 3.0 as an Electron, mobile or web application are included.

## Setting up a Dev Environment
 - Clone the repo
 - Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
 - Change into the cloned directory and run `yarn install`. If you only want to make a custom theme, you do not need to do this!
 - IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for development.
 
## Building for Electron
 - **Windows only:** To build native Node assets, you will need to install Python and the Visual C++ 2015 Build tools. [More information can be found in the node-gyp docs.](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
    - `npm install --global --production --vs2015 --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools node-gyp`
 - Change into the `electron` directory.
 - Run `yarn build`/`yarn watch` to build assets. They are placed into the `app` directory.
 - Run `yarn start` to start the app in debug mode. Use `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the Chromium debugger.

### Building a Release Package (Electron)
 1. `cd electron`
 1. `yarn build:dist`
 1. `node pack.js`


### Packaging
> This section is outdated and left here for reference purposes only.

~~See https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/application-distribution/~~
~~Run `cd electron && yarn build:dist` to create a minified production build.~~
~~Run `yarn run pack`. The generated installer is placed into the `dist` directory.~~
~~On Windows you can add the path to and password for a code signing certificate as arguments.~~
~~On Mac you can add your code signing identity as an argument. `zip` is required to be installed.~~
~~On Linux you can add a GPG key for signing and its password as arguments. `mksquashfs` and `zsyncmake` are required to be installed.~~

## Building for Mobile
> Mobile builds are not supported. This section is outdated and left here for reference purposes only. 
>
> Are you a kickass mobile developer? Maybe you can help us fix the build.

~~Change into the `mobile` directory.~~
~~Run `yarn build`/`yarn watch` to build assets. They are placed into the `www` directory.~~
~~For Android, change into the `android` directory and run `./gradlew assembleDebug`. The generated APK is placed into `app/build/outputs/apk`.~~
~~For iOS, change into the `ios` directory and open `F-Chat.xcodeproj` using XCode. From there, simply run the app using the play button.~~

## Building for Web
> Web builds are not supported. This section is outdated and left here for reference purposes only. 
>
> Are you a kickass web developer? Maybe you can help us fix the build.

~~Change into the `webchat` directory.~~
~~Run `yarn build`/`yarn watch` to build assets. They are placed into the `dist` directory.~~
~~The compiled main.js file can be included by an HTML file that is expected to provide a global `const chatSettings: {account: string, theme: string, characters: ReadonlyArray<string>, defaultCharacter: string | null};`. It should also normalize the page to 100% height.~~

## Building a custom theme
See [the wiki](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0/Themes) for instructions on how to create a custom theme.
 - Change into the `scss` directory.
 - Run `yarn install`.
 - Run `yarn build themes/chat/{name}.scss`.
 - Your theme file will be placed into the `scss/css` directory.

## Dependencies
Note: Adding *and upgrading* dependencies should only be done with prior consideration and subsequent testing.

That's why `yarn.lock` exists and is version controlled.

To upgrade NPM dependencies, run `yarn upgrade` locally. Run `yarn outdated` to see pending upgrades.

If you encounter error 'Could not detect abi for version X.X.X and runtime electron', try running
`npx uuaw node-abi`
